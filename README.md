Let's finish programming a wonderful game together.

File structure:

- `.gitignore`: Defines the files to be excluded from the git repo. This includes `.pyc` files and other IDE/editor-specific config files. Modify this file if your IDE/editor generates irrelevant files.
- `src/`: Contains the source files.
- `res/`: Contains sounds, images, maps, etc.
- `doc/`: Contains documentations.
